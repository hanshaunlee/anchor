# Fixtures archive

Sample fixture files preserved for reference. Not loaded by the app in demo mode (demo uses the fixtures in the parent directory). Useful as schema examples or for local experiments.

- **scenario_replay.json** — Example replay payload (risk_score_timeline, agent_trace). Generated by `scripts/demo_replay.py` into `demo_out/`; can be copied here if needed.
- **graph_evidence.json** — Minimal graph (nodes/edges) in API shape.
